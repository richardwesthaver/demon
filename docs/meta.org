This project is made public for educational purposes only, and has no
official Public API. All code is unlicensed but I encourage you to
check out the dependency crates for building a project of your own.

* Getting Started
** Using the Makefile
	 - install dependencies: GNUMake
	 - ~make help~
** Run a binary
	 - ~cargo run --bin $bin_name~
		 - nan
		 - bw
		 - curse
* Core

** Design
Our framework is primarily built upon the [[https://libp2p.io/][libp2p]] network stack, and
thus provides an opinionated implementation of many of its core
modules. You can see a full list of the types of modules, and their
current status [[https://libp2p.io/implementations/][here]].

The libp2p docs are quite in-depth, but quite verbose. Here are some
of the core concepts which we'll refer to frequently:
- *Peer* - An individual member of a libp2p network
- *PeerID* - Identifies a unique Peer (by the multihash of its Public Key)
- *Dial* - Opposite to *listen*, refers to an attempt to contact a peer
- *Connection* - A reliable, bidirectional communication channel between two peers
- *Transport* - The underlying interface used to build connections (TCP/UDP/Unix sockets)
- *Multiaddress* - A modular addressing format that supports combining network layers (/ip4/127.0.0.1/udp/1234)
- *STUN* - enabled by [[https://lwn.net/Articles/542629/][SO_REUSEPORT]] socket option, also known as hole-punching
- *TURN* - defined in [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5766][RFC 5766]], implemented as 'Circuit Relays' in libp2p
- *Switch* - sometimes called the "swarm", provides a dialing and listening interface
